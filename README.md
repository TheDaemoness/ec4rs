# ec4rs: EditorConfig For Rust
[![CI](https://github.com/TheDaemoness/ec4rs/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TheDaemoness/ec4rs/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

An `std`-only EditorConfig library in pure safe Rust.

Name idea shamelessly stolen from [ec4j](https://github.com/ec4j/ec4j).

_Status note:
This project passes almost all of the EditorConfig core test suite.
Its glob implementation is fully compliant.
The final compliance issues will be resolved soon.
Its API will change somewhat prior to the 1.0.0 release._

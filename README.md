# ec4rs: EditorConfig For Rust
[![CI](https://github.com/TheDaemoness/ec4rs/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TheDaemoness/ec4rs/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

An std-only editorconfig library in pure safe Rust.

Name idea shamelessly stolen from [ec4j](https://github.com/ec4j/ec4j).

This project includes:
* A library for parsing EditorConfig files.
* An optional binary for testing the above library's compliance.
